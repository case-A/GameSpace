GameSpace is an app that is made by a gamer for other gamers. Similar to Steam, it allows Gamers to leave reviews about their favorite games, but includes PC and console games all in one place. 

As the creator of this app, I've always wanted a place to read game reviews that weren't backed by big developers which in turn inflates its actual quality. As prices for games increase due to improvement and technological advancements in games in performance and visuals, and it being nearly impossible to return games after purchase, it becomes ever more important for Gamers to choose wisely when making a game purchase. My hope for this app is that it grows to become more than just a review website, but a community for all types of gamers.

-Allows users to write their own reviews
